## **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Cleaned and prepared a dataset of 150,000+ records by handling duplicates, filling missing values, and normalizing data.  

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Conducted in-depth analysis of user engagement, application preferences, and handset performance.  
  - Visualized data distribution, correlations, and trends using interactive plots and graphs.  

- **User Engagement and Clustering**:  
  - Segmented users into engagement categories using K-Means Clustering.  
  - Identified the most-used applications and analyzed their traffic contributions.  

- **Predictive Modeling**:  
  - Built a Random Forest Regressor to predict customer satisfaction scores.  
  - Saved the trained model using `pickle` for future usage.  

- **Streamlit Dashboard**:  
  - Created an interactive dashboard for real-time visualization of insights and metrics.  
  - Enables stakeholders to explore user engagement, experience scores, and satisfaction levels.  

- **SQL Server Integration**:  
  - Exported aggregated scores and insights to a SQL Server database for structured storage.  
  - Configured the database with table creation and automated data insertion.
