although there's room for improvement, particularly with overfitting in the model and clustering results.
- The integration with SQL for data storage adds value to your work, making it scalable for future use.
- The analysis is thorough, and the steps are clearly defined.
- However, further refinement in feature selection, clustering, and model generalization would enhance your results.
